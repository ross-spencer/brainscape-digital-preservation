"Format Identification","Format identification has previously been accepted as the first step of digital preservation ‘knowing what you’ve got’ the volume of material that some organisations are responsible for, however, makes this an ideal, but not necessarily a practicality. <br/> File format identification means looking at a digital file’s data (it’s binary content) for patterns that identify it as being structured similar to other files of the same ‘format'. Reading the pattern “PDF- 1.4” at the beginning of some files, may for example, be a good clue the file is going to be a PDF.<br/>Where a binary pattern cannot be ascribed to a digital file, either one isn’t known, or the file doesn’t conform to one, then other clues may be used. File extension may be one. File name may be another, e.g. consistently named files, DS_Store, or Thumbs.db. "
"File Format Extension","A file extension is part of a file’s name. The extension is commonly three characters in length and prefixed with a dot. For the file name, ‘example.txt’ the extension is .txt. Registries of extensions exist where they can be looked up and asigned to a file. A file extension has no bearing on the content of a file, as such, a file that has the file extension .pdf is not guaranteed to be .pdf. A file may not have the right extension for a number of reasons, including for circumventing information security measures (e.g. certain upload types on a website); users adopting a temporary scheme e.g. renaming a file .backup;  or users may not know the appropriate one, e.g. assigning .xls (Microsoft Excel) to a .csv (comma-separated-values table format) "
"File Format Signature","A file format signature is a sequence, or sequences of bytes inside a digital file. Bytes become human readable when looked at through a hex (hexadecimal) editing tool.<br/>At the beginning of a Microsoft Word file, for example, one may find the hexadecimal values, <pre>0xD0 0xCF 0x11 0xE0</pre> (DOC FILE) – 0x denotes hexadecimal. Taken verbatim, these four bytes can be used by a tool to categorise any files that also begin with the same sequence. The skill in crafting a good file format signature is finding a set of sequences unique enough to group all files belonging to a single file format; broad enough so as not to miss a single file; and narrow enough not to falsely identify other files – a false positive.<br/>File format signatures are often described in file format specifications but they may still need crafting into something that can be used by tools such as DROID.   "
"Magic Number","✨Magic✨ number is often used as a synonym for file format signature. The etymology for the term dates back to the seventh version of the Unix operating system (1979). The use of magic numbers grew as requirements for them did. The use of the phrase file format signature seems to have come about through the maturisation of the field of digital preservation. "
"Web Archiving","The process of crawling a website in its current form and saving it, and its resorces (images, sound files, etc.) offline. Web archives will often also make the snapshot available through an online portal as well. Snapshots are sophisticated ‘crawls’ of the domain home page and all the hyperlinks stemming off from there and on and on. How deep, or how far a crawler will go is determined by the archiving institution. Jurasdictions will often be responsible for sets of websites on various top level domains, e.g. the British Library are responsible for archiving .co.uk, while The National Archives, UK are responsible for .gov.uk  "
"Web Crawling","Web crawling is the process by which the content of a single web page is read, archived, and all of the hyperlinks referenced on it are indexed. The ‘crawl’ process then visits the indexed hyperlinks, and repeats the process. The number of links to follow and repeat the process is called crawl-depth. Organisations may have different strategies for utilizing crawl depth. Tools distributed with Linux such as Wget can crawl websites. A common tool used in the digital preservation community is called Heritrix. "
"Robots.txt","A mechanism web-sites can employ to communicate with web-crawlers to prevent them from accessing them. Robots.txt can be employed to prevent spurious requests from non-altruistic bots, or other practical reasons like the domain only having a limited amount of bandwidth available to it per month. Robots.txt can be configured for all or parts of a web site. Crawlers may not always cooperate with the protocol. "
"Fixity","Fixity is the mechanism used to identify whether the content of something has changed at all – literally the things that are fixed which should not change. We can use filename, for example, when comparing a file with what is listed in an archival catalogue. File system dates are useful, e.g. last modified date on a file. A more fault-tolerant way of ensuring that the content hasn’t changed in a digital object is to use a checksum algorithm to create a unique mathematical digest of the file’s contents. Example checksums include MD5, SHA1, and BLAKE-512. More often than not, when discussing fixity in digital preservation we will be discussing checksums. "
"Risk","From risk management, the formal statement of a risk in the form, because of x there is a risk that y which will result in z. The statement enables us to think about risk in terms of its impact."
"Obsolescence","Obsolescence is the process of becoming obsolete. Obsolescence is identified as a cause for data potentially becoming unreadable. Obsolescence is synonymous with the terms out-dated and no-longer used. Given the number of dependencies on which a piece of technology relies: operating system, memory type, mains power voltage, creating application, etc. There are a number of components that we’re monitoring in digital preservation for obsolescence. Theoretically we can mitigate obsolescence. through whichever strategy is appropriate to the archival institutions requirements. "
"Data Obfuscation","When information is hidden or modified in a way that cannot be easily read then it is said to be obfuscated. Redaction, password protection, and encryption are three such methods. The latter two pose risk to successful digital preservation as they impact the ability to read the information in a record. Encryption impacts the ability to read the binary content of a file entirely. . "
"Metadata","Metadata is any information that describes a digital record. Records may be self-describing meaning that the metadata can be read from the file, e.g. author is sometimes encoded in a file. Metadata can also be derived from the digital object’s content, e.g. word count, audio length. We may also talk about file system metadata which the operating system uses to describe a digital object; modification and creation dates are two such examples. "
"Metadata Extraction","The extraction of metadata from a digital object, often using tools that can read the file and export the information in a machine-readable form such as XML or JSON. "
"Characterization","Characterization is whereby metadata crucial to the preservation of the digital object is recorded. This information may describe the object itself or its technical environment."
"Significant Properties","Properties of individual records or groups of records that may be prioritised for preservation, and used as a measure of a successful ‘preservation action'. Significant properties may become important when it is deemed impossible to preserve all aspects of a digital object. Examples of significant properties may include, word count, colour profile, interactivity, etc. "
"Metadata Mapping","The process of selecting metadata about a digital object and encoding it into an alternative schema, e.g. for archival description, or preservation."
"Digital Humanities","The use of digital techniques to support the scholarly study of the humanities (Literature, Archaeology, Architecture etc.). "
"Digital Archive (DIN Standard Definition)","An organisation (consisting of people and technical systems) which has assumed responsibility for the long-term preservation and long-term availability of digital data and its provision for a specified designated community."
"Digital Preservation (Library of Congress)","Digital preservation is the active management of digital content over time to ensure ongoing access. "
"Digital Preservation (AV Preserve) ","Digital preservation is a function of digital curation, in which digital content is prepared and actively managed for long-term access. Digital content requires constant, active management. At the most basic level, this includes managing multiple copies in different geographic locations, ongoing and consistent comparison of the same files in multiple locations to ensure that no changes have occurred to them (this is called fixity checking) and performing healing procedures when files no longer match up, and maintaining audit logs from the time of ingest into the archival system that tracks all activities, like access and changes to the files over time."
"Digital Preservation System","A system, or set of systems and tools, that enable digital preservation. A system may be contrived of components for ingest, storage, preservation management, and access, as well as other functions. Industry examples include RODA, Archivematica, Preservica, and Rosetta."
"Archive Management System","An archive management system commonly wraps functions that are not part of a digital preservation system. An archive management system enables the description of digital records and the provision of context relevant or one or more archival models. A connection must exist between the archive management system and a digital preservation system to allow digital records to be retrieved by their catalogue references. "
"CMS/ECMS","Content Management System/Enterprise Content Management System are contemporary methods of maintaining digital records in an organisation. Systems manage storage and retrieval of records across the organisation for all users. Systems will implement retention and disposal schedules, as well as wrapping records in suitable record keeping and discovery metadata. "
"Trusted Repository","A repository certified as trusted following an audit using the measures defined in ISO standard 16363:2012. A trusted repository will conform to measures surrounding Organizational Infrastructure. Digital Object Management. Infrastructure and Security Risk Management. Bodies providing audit and assessment must also conform to ISO standard 16919:2014."
"Validity","A file format and its informational content that follows a set of rules defined in its specification is considered valid. "
"Well-Formed","A file format that conforms to a structure defined by its specification is well-formed. "
"Intellectual Entity (PREMIS)","An Intellectual Entity is a distinct intellectual or artistic creation that is considered relevant to a designated community in the context of digital preservation: for example, a particular book, map, photograph, database, or hardware or software. An Intellectual Entity can include other Intellectual Entities; for example, a web site can include a web page and a web page can include an image. An Intellectual Entity may have one or more digital or non-digital Representations."
"Representation (PREMIS)","A Representation is the set of files, including structural metadata, needed for a complete rendition of an Intellectual Entity. For example, a journal article may be complete in one PDF file; this single file constitutes the Representation. Another journal article may consist of one HTML file and two image files; these three files constitute the Representation. A third article may be represented by one TIFF image for each of 12 pages plus an XML file of structural metadata showing the order of the pages; these 13 files constitute the Representation. "
"Standards","A standard is commonly a set of recommendations and principles, that may or may not require absolute compliance. From the International Organization for Standardization's perspective (ISO), standards provide specifications for products, services, and systems, that help ensure quality, safety, and efficiency. In the digital preservation community, standards help to create a lingua franca as a platform to communicate upon. "
"Bitrot","The loss of data through degradation of a carrier medium, e.g. the loss of magnetic resonance on a floppy disk leading to the file allocation table (file directory) becoming unreadable. "
"Active Management","The continuous monitoring of digital objects for changes in their bitstream. The monitoring of a file on a file system for bit rot. "
"Preservation Watch","The monitoring of the technical aspects of a digital object for obsolescence., e.g. the current long-term support status of a piece of software, or the introduction of a newer specification of a file format or standard."
"Bit-level preservation","The process of correcting a digital file that has suffered bit-rot, identified through the process of active management."
"Dark Archive (Storage)","The use of offline, or near-line storage of archival materials. Little or no immediate access is provided. Files are preserved through bit-level preservation unless a concerted intervention is made by the archival institution."
"Dark Archive (Access)","The gamut of archival or preservation systems can be used, but there is zero public access to the records. A dark archive configuration like this may be used because information content demands it to be protected in such a way."
"Audit (AV Preserve)","A review of a system to ensure compliance. The outcome of an audit is binary – either you pass or fail."
"Assessment (AV Preserve)","An assessment looks at how a system is succeeding and where there are gaps. The outcome of an assessment is feedback for growth; identification of gaps in practice; and spotlights strengths. Assessments completed regularly may lead to a successful pass on an audit in future. "
"Organizational Alignment (AV Preserve)","Beyond OAIS like digital preservation systems; the coordination of digital preservation 'outside-the-box' across the organization. Organizations may be complex and there's a recognition that content of value is not managed consistently in a long-term way consistent with digital preservation principles. Operationalizing digital preservation. "
"Library Carpentry","The development of practical digital skills, such as programming basics, for use in the GLAM sector. "
"Big Data","<i><b>Warning:</b> One of many definitions!</i><br/>A popular definition of big data is data that requires a certain amount of computation to be able to ask research questions and draw sensible conclusions from.<br/>A working definition of 'big data' seems to be a range from Gigabytes (querying portions of your collections for keywords, for example), to the generation of A Gigabyte a second (the amount of data produced, per second, by the Lard Hadron Collider in Switzerland) "
"Digital Continuity","The idea that preservation of digital records happens in situ in the organisation creating the records. Principles of digital preservation apply, the custodianship of an archival institution is not needed to apply them. "
"Audit Trail","Related to the concept of provenance, an audit trail describes the agents and actors that have accessed a digital resource and the processes (read, write, transform) that have been applied to that resource. "
"Migration","The transformation of a file format into another file format with the same, or similar properties, e.g. migration of a JPEG image to PNG. Migration is a potential method of preserving digital information. The key for many users is the measurement and quality analysis of properties apparent in the data before, and after migration, and an understanding of what may be lost along the way. "
"Emulation","The recreation of legacy, or current, computer architecture in software (an emulator) such that it can then be used to run the operating system and software of the original hardware. Emulation is a potential method of delivery of ‘preserved’ content to users. Those who want to access content will do so by interacting with the computer system as-was, or as-is. A popular emulator is used in the Internet Archive to enable full interaction and playability or retro pc/dos computer games archived by the service. "
