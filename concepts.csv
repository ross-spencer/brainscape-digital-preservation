"Format Identification","Format identification has previously been accepted as the first step of digital preservation ‘knowing what you’ve got’ the volume of material that some organisations are responsbile for, however, makes this an ideal, but not necessarily a practicality. <br/> File format identification means looking at a digital file’s data (it’s binary content) for patterns that identify it as being structured similar to other files of the same ‘format’. Reading the pattern “PDF- 1.4” at the beginning of some files, may for example, be a good clue the file is going to be a PDF.<br/>Where a binary pattern cannot be ascribed to a digital file, either one isn’t known, or the file doesn’t conform, then other clues may be used. File format extension may be one. File name may be another, e.g. consistently named files, DS_Store, or Thumbs.db. "

"Digital Preservation (AV Preserve) ","Digital preservation is a function of digital curation, in which digital content is prepared and actively managed for long-term access. Digital content requires constant, active management. At the most basic level, this includes managing multiple copies in diferent geographic locations, ongoing and consistent comparison of the same files in multiple locations to ensure that no changes have occurred to them (this is called fixity checking) and performing healing procedures when files no longer match up, and maintaining audit logs from the time of ingest into the archival system that tracks all activities, like access and changes to the files over time."

From the International Organization for Standardization's perspective (ISO), standards provide specifications for products, services, and systems, that help ensure quality, safety, and efficiency. In the digital preservation community, standards help to create a lingua franca as a platform to communicate upon. "

"Assessment (AV Preserve)","An assessment looks at how a system is succeeding and where there are gaps. The outcome of an assessment is feedback for growth; identification of gapis in practice; and spotlights strenghts. Assessments completed regularly may lead to a successful pass on an audit in future. "
"Organizational Alignment (AV Preserve)","Beyond OAIS like digital preservation systems; the coordination of digital preservation 'outside-the-box' across the organization. Organizations may be complex and there's a recognition that content of value is not managed consistently in a long-term way conistent with digital preservation principles. Operationalizing digital preservation. "
