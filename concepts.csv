Format Identification,"<p class=""large"" style=""text-align: center;""><strong><span class=""large"">Format Identification</span></strong></p>","<ul>	<li>Format identification has previously been accepted as the first step of digital preservation ‘knowing what you’ve got’ the volume of material that some organisations are responsible for, however, makes this an ideal, but not necessarily a practicality.</li>	<li>File format identification means looking at a digital file’s data (it’s binary content) for patterns that match the structures of specific file formats. </li>	<li>Reading the pattern ""PDF- 1.4"" at the beginning of some files, may for example, be a good clue the file is going to be a PDF.</li>	<li>Where a binary pattern cannot be ascribed to a digital file, either one isn’t known, or the file doesn’t conform to one, then other clues may be used.</li>	<li>File extension may be a clue as to a file format e.g. CSV (Comma Separated Values).</li>	<li>File name may be another, e.g. consistently named files, DS_Store, or Thumbs.db.</li></ul>"
File Format Extension,"<p class=""large"" style=""text-align: center;""><span class=""large""><strong>File Format Extension</strong></span></p>","<ul>	<li class=""medium"">A file extension is part of a file’s name.</li>	<li class=""medium"">The extension is commonly three characters in length and prefixed with a dot.</li>	<li class=""medium"">For the file name, ‘example.txt’ the extension is .txt.</li>	<li class=""medium"">Registries of extensions exist that they can be searched and an ID asigned to a file.</li>	<li class=""medium"">A file extension has no bearing on the content of a file, as such, a file that has the file extension .pdf is not guaranteed to be .pdf.</li>	<li class=""medium"">A file may not have the right extension for a number of reasons, including for circumventing information security measures (e.g. certain upload types on a website).</li>	<li class=""medium"">Users may also adopt a temporary naming scheme e.g. renaming a file .backup, or .tmp.</li>	<li class=""medium"">Users may not know the appropriate extension and so might provide another, e.g. assigning .xls (Microsoft Excel) to a .csv (comma-separated-values table format)</li></ul>"
File Format Signature,"<p class=""large"" style=""text-align: center;""><span class=""large""><strong>File Format Signature</strong></span></p>","<ul>	<li>A file format signature is a sequence, or sequences of bytes inside a digital file. Bytes become human readable when looked at through a hex (hexadecimal) editing tool.</li>	<li>At the beginning of a Microsoft Word file, for example, one may find the hexadecimal values,</li></ul><pre style=""text-align: center;"">0xD0 0xCF 0x11 0xE0</pre><ul>	<li>(DOC FILE) – 0x denotes hexadecimal.</li>	<li>Taken verbatim, these four bytes can be used by a tool to categorise any files that also begin with the same sequence.</li>	<li>The skill in crafting a good file format signature is finding a set of sequences unique enough to group all files belonging to a single file format; broad enough so as not to miss a single file; and narrow enough not to falsely identify other files – a false positive.</li>	<li>File format signatures are often described in file format specifications but they may still need crafting into something more useful that can be used by tools such as DROID.</li></ul>"
Magic Number,"<p class=""large"" style=""text-align: center;""><strong><span class=""large"">Magic Number</span></strong></p>","<p class=""medium"" style=""text-align: center;"">✨Magic✨ number is often used as a synonym for file format signature.</p><p class=""medium"" style=""text-align: center;"">The etymology for the term dates back to the seventh version of the Unix operating system (1979).</p><p class=""medium"" style=""text-align: center;"">The use of magic numbers grew as requirements for them did.

Web Crawling,"<p class=""large"" style=""text-align: center;""><strong><span class=""large"">Web Crawling</span></strong></p>","<ul>	<li class=""medium"">Web crawling is the process by which the content of a single web page is read, archived, and all of the hyperlinks referenced on it are indexed.</li>	<li class=""medium"">The ‘crawl’ process then visits the indexed hyperlinks, and repeats the process.</li>	<li class=""medium"">The number of links to follow and repeat the process is called crawl-depth.</li>	<li class=""medium"">Organisations may have different strategies for utilizing crawl depth.</li>	<li class=""medium"">Tools distributed with Linux such as Wget can crawl websites and a common tool used in the digital preservation community is called Heritrix.</li></ul>"

Crawlers may not always cooperate with the protocol.</li>	<li class=""medium"">The Internet Archive ignores Robots.txt for Government Archives.</li></ul>"
Fixity,"<p class=""large"" style=""text-align: center;""><span class=""large""><strong>Fixity</strong></span></p>","<ul>	<li class=""medium"">Fixity is the mechanism used to identify whether the content of something has changed at all – literally the things that are fixed which should not change.</li>	<li class=""medium"">We can use filename, for example, when comparing a file with what is listed in an archival catalogue.</li>	<li class=""medium"">File system dates are useful, e.g. last modified date on a file.</li>	<li class=""medium"">A more fault-tolerant way of ensuring that the content hasn’t changed in a digital object is to use a checksum algorithm to create a unique mathematical digest of the file’s contents.</li>	<li class=""medium"">Example checksums include <strong>MD5</strong>, <strong>SHA1</strong>, and <strong>BLAKE-512</strong>.</li>	<li class=""medium"">More often than not, when discussing fixity in digital preservation we will be discussing checksums.</li></ul>"

""</em></p><p class=""medium"" style=""text-align: center;"">The statement enables us to think about risk in terms of its impact and therefore steers us away from the concept of risk as in fear. </p><p class=""medium"" style=""text-align: center;"">Impacts should be measurable, and real.</p>"
