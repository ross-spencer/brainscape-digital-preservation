"RiC-CM","Records in Context Content Model (RiC-CM) is a proposed standard from the International Council of Archives. It is a descriptive standards that  incorporates the four existing ICA description standards, ISAD(G), ISAAR(CPF), ISDF, and ISDIAH. The standard recognises changing technologies and embraces graph technologies for description. The standard emphasies the preservation of the context in which records live. Overall, the standard exists to support the management of records; preservation of records and their context; and the reuse of records. "
"Open Provenance Model","The Open Provenance Model is a model of provenance that is designed to meet the requirements:<br/><ul><li>(1) To allow provenance information to be exchanged between systems, by means of a compatibility layer based on a shared provenance model.</li><li> (2) To allow developers to build and share tools that operate on such a provenance model.</li><li> (3) To define provenance in a precise, technology-agnostic manner.</li><li> (4) To support a digital representation of provenance for any 'thing', whether produced by computer systems or not. </li><li>(5) To allow multiple levels of description to coexist.</li><li> (6) To define a core set of rules that identify the valid inferences that can be made on provenance representation.</li></ul> "
"PREMIS","<ul><li>Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies (Working Group), initially developed the PREMIS data dictionary as a specification with the goal of creating an implementable set of ""core"" preservation metadata elements, with broad applicability within the digital preservation community.</li><br/><li>The PREMIS Editorial Committee coordinates revisions and implementation of the standard.</li><br/><li>PREMIS is system and encoding, agnostic. It defines ""what a preservation repository needs to know"". As such the repository that implements PREMIS may find itself doing so in any way that is fit for that institution.</li></ul>"
"Dublin Core","The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set is a vocabulary of fifteen properties for use in resource description. The name ""Dublin"" is due to its origin at a 1995 invitational workshop in Dublin, Ohio; ""core"" because its elements are broad and generic, usable for describing a wide range of resources. The fifteen element ""Dublin Core"" described in this standard is part of a larger set of metadata vocabularies and technical specifications maintained by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI). The full set of vocabularies, DCMI Metadata Terms [DCMI-TERMS], also includes sets of resource classes (including the DCMI Type Vocabulary [DCMI-TYPE]), vocabulary encoding schemes, and syntax encoding schemes. The terms in DCMI vocabularies are intended to be used in combination with terms from other, compatible vocabularies in the context of application profiles and on the basis of the DCMI Abstract Model [DCAM]."
