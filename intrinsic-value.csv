"Intrinsic Value and Digital","Value intrinsic to a record that cannot alone be captured through copying or transcription. According to the Society of American Archivists the value intrinsic to the record may come from: form, layout, materials, or process. It may also be based on an item's direct relationship to a significant person, activity, event, organization, or place. Intrinsic value for digital records may be hard to define. This deck attempts to showcase important digital artefacts with intrinsic value. "

"Treaty Digitisation","The Treaty of Waitangi is one of two UNESCO Memory of the World recognised documents held by Archives New Zealand. While digitization is not preservation in its own right, the treaty’s nine pages have previously been mistreated meaning today they are in much poorer state than they should be for 200 years old. Each new scan has its tradeoffs but each new scan also helps conservators to see its state over time, and so it has its advantages too. There are currently two digitsed sets of images preserved digitally in Rosetta at Archives NZ.  "
