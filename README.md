## Intrinsic Value

* I would dearly love to see more added to the intrinsic value cards, is it a 
thing in digital? If it is, what records? and if it is, maybe it provides more 
evidence to folks that be that what we're doing is important. Positive evidence
not just evidence based on risk.

The material in these decks is purely for educational purposes. A lot, but not all content in these decks is unique. For example, it was easier to copy organisation mission statements and principles almost verbatim where they were available and not overly promotional. Tool text in some cases as well. Reuse therefore is with a prejudicial warning.
