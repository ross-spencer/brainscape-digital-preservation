"PRONOM","PRONOM is a registry of file format information maintained by The National Archives, UK. PRONOM has an open contribution model but is curated by the teams at the organisation. PRONOM was published on the web for the first time  in 2004. It contains narrative information about a file format, relevant to digital preservation. Its strength however is that it provides a centralized mechanism for the tool DROID to download file format ‘signatures’ from. These signatures are encoded using a regular expression syntax and allow DROID to continuously be updated. Tools such as Siegfried can also use these signatures, and as such, PRONOM is a de-facto standard for this type of information in the digtial preservation community. "
"DROID","DROID stands for Digital Record and Object Identification and was developed by The National Archives, UK whom it is still maintained by. Users of DROID point it at a collection of files and it will identify them based on their binary content.<br/>DROID is updated using the PRONOM registry which means it can remain up-to-date with modern signatures for the identification of digital files.<br/>DROID can be used from the command line, but it is more difficult to work with it programmatically. Tools like NANITE wrap DROID to enable easier integration with code. "
"JHOVE","JHOVE utilizes the concepts of well-formedness and validity to return statistics about 14 different file formats including PNG, TIFF, and WAVE Audio. JHOVE will tell users whether their file is well-formed, or valid; both; or neither. Rules which determine this are encoded in the tool and have been elicited from the file format specifications for those file types. JHOVE is maintained by the Open Preservation Foundation. The tool was originally developed by Harvard University Libraries (HUL) and Gary McGath.  "
"Siegfried","Siegfried is an open source tool developed independently by Richard Lehane. It utilizes a number of file format signature and identification mechanisms, and was developed initially utilizing those from the format registry PRONOM. "
"Roy","Roy is a companion tool for Siegfried that allows the data source used by the tool to be customized. Such customizing might mean not using the entire corpus of signatures available to it, e.g. if you know you only want to provide file format identification for digital images in a digitization workflow.
