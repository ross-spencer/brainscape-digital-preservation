PRONOM,"<p class=""large"" style=""text-align: center;""><strong><span class=""large"">PRONOM</span></strong></p>","<ul>	<li class=""medium"">PRONOM is a registry of file format information maintained by The National Archives, UK (TNA). PRONOM has an open contribution model but is curated by the teams at TNA.</li>	<li class=""medium"">First published on the web in 2004.</li>	<li class=""medium"">Contains narrative information about a file format, relevant to digital preservation.</li>	<li class=""medium"">Strength however is that it provides a centralized mechanism for the tool DROID to download file format ‘signatures’ from.</li>	<li class=""medium"">Signatures are encoded using PRONOM regular expression syntax and allow DROID to continuously be updated.</li>	<li class=""medium"">Tools such as Siegfried can also use these signatures, and as such, PRONOM is a de-facto standard for this type of information in the digital preservation community.</li></ul>"
DROID,"<p class=""large"" style=""text-align: center;""><span class=""large""><strong>DROID</strong></span></p>","<ul>	<li>DROID stands for Digital Record and Object Identification</li>	<li>Developed and maintained by The National Archives, UK </li>	<li>Identifies the file formats in a collection of files based on their binary content</li>	<li>Updated using the PRONOM registry which means it can remain up-to-date with modern signatures for the identification of digital files</li>	<li>Can be used from the command line</li>	<li>Programmatically, tools like NANITE wrap DROID to enable easier integration with code</li></ul>"
Nanite,"<p class=""large"" style=""text-align: center;""><strong><span class=""large"">Nanite</span></strong></p>","<ul>	<li class=""medium"">The Nanite project builds on DROID and Apache Tika to provide a rich format identification and characterization system.</li>	<li class=""medium"">It aims to make it easier to run identification and characterisation at scale, and helps compare and combine the results of different tools.</li>	<li class=""medium"">Nanite provides an API (application programming interface) for DROID where DROID currently doesn’t have an open (easy to work with) API.</li>	<li class=""medium"">Nanite was developed by Andy Jackson of the British Library and the UK Web Archive.</li></ul>"
JHOVE,"<p class=""large"" style=""text-align: center;""><span class=""large""><strong>JHOVE</strong></span></p>","<ul>	<li class=""medium"">JHOVE uses the concepts of well-formedness and validity to return statistics about different file formats.</li>	<li class=""medium"">14 different file formats including PNG, TIFF, and WAVE Audio.</li>	<li class=""medium"">JHOVE can tell users whether their file is well-formed; valid; both; or neither.</li>	<li class=""medium"">Rules which determine this are encoded in the tool and have been elicited from the file format specifications for those file types.</li>	<li class=""medium"">JHOVE is maintained by the Open Preservation Foundation.</li>	<li class=""medium"">It was originally developed by Harvard University Libraries (HUL) and Gary McGath.</li></ul>"
Siegfried,"<p class=""large"" style=""text-align: center;""><strong><span class=""large"">Siegfried</span></strong></p>","<ul>	<li class=""medium"">Siegfried is a tool that performs a similar function to DROID.</li>	<li class=""medium"">Developed independently by Richard Lehane of State Archives New South Wales (SANSW/SRNSW).</li>	<li class=""medium"">Free and Open Source</li>	<li class=""medium"">Incorporates a number of file format signature and identification mechanisms; not just that of PRONOM.</li>	<li class=""medium"">Developed initially using the PRONOM specification and can use all of PRONOM's signatures.</li></ul>"
Roy,"<p class=""large"" style=""text-align: center;""><strong><span class=""large"">Roy</span></strong></p>","<ul>	<li class=""medium"">A companion tool for Siegfried that allows the data source (signature file) used by Siegfried to be customized.</li>	<li class=""medium"">Customizing includes the option of not using the entire corpus of signatures available to it.</li>	<li class=""medium"">An example might include creating a singature file to just identify images, e.g. as a result of a digitization workflow.</li>	<li class=""medium"">A smaller singature file can, theoretically, be quicker than the entire corpus. </li></ul>"
File,"<p class=""large"" style=""text-align: center;""><strong><span class=""large"">File</span></strong></p>","<ul>	<li class=""medium"">A command on Linux that uses a combination of magic numbers and heuristic to determine a file’s format and version.</li>	<li class=""medium"">The original File command was included in Unix version 4, 1973.</li>	<li class=""medium"">The modern File command is a variant on those early versions, and is still updated and maintained.</li>	<li class=""medium"">The primary point of difference between File and tools like DROID is the lack of unique identifier for a format type.</li>	<li class=""medium"">A unique identifier could potentially make it easier to use the tool's output in a digital preservation system.</li></ul>"
