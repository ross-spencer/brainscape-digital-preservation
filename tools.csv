"PRONOM","PRONOM is a registry of file format information maintained by The National Archives, UK. PRONOM has an open contribution model but is curated by the teams at the organisation. PRONOM was published on the web for the first time  in 2004. It contains narrative information about a file format, relevant to digital preservation. Its strength however is that it provides a centralized mechanism for the tool DROID to download file format ‘signatures’ from. These signatures are encoded using a regular expression syntax and allow DROID to continuously be updated. Tools such as Siegfried can also use these signatures, and as such, PRONOM is a de-facto standard for this type of information in the digtial preservation community. "
"DROID","DROID stands for Digital Record and Object Identification and was developed by The National Archives, UK whom it is still maintained by. Users of DROID point it at a collection of files and it will identify them based on their binary content.<br/>DROID is updated using the PRONOM registry which means it can remain up-to-date with modern signatures for the identification of digital files.<br/>DROID can be used from the command line, but it is more difficult to work with it programmatically. Tools like NANITE wrap DROID to enable easier integration with code. "
"JHOVE","JHOVE utilizes the concepts of well-formedness and validity to return statistics about 14 different file formats including PNG, TIFF, and WAVE Audio. JHOVE will tell users whether their file is well-formed, or valid; both; or neither. Rules which determine this are encoded in the tool and have been elicited from the file format specifications for those file types. JHOVE is maintained by the Open Preservation Foundation. The tool was originally developed by Harvard University Libraries (HUL) and Gary McGath.  "
"Siegfried","Siegfried is an open source tool developed independently by Richard Lehane. It utilizes a number of file format signature and identification mechanisms, and was developed initially utilizing those from the format registry PRONOM. "
"Roy","Roy is a companion tool for Siegfried that allows the data source used by the tool to be customized. Such customizing might mean not using the entire corpus of signatures available to it, e.g. if you know you only want to provide file format identification for digital images in a digitization workflow. "
"File","File is a command on Linux that uses a combination of magic numbers and heuristic to determine a file’s format and version. The original File was included in Unix version 4, 1973. The modern File command is a variant on those early versions, and is still updated and maintained. The difference between File and tools like DROID is the lack of unique identifier for a format type. This makes it harder to reference in preservation databases. "
"ffmprovisr","A online resource of ‘recipes’, that is, commands for achieving complex results from the open source audio visual transcode and characterization tool ffmpeg."
"ffmpeg","A free and open source tool for working with audio and video. Ffmpeg can characterize multimedia, even output visual analyses; ffmpeg can transcode it into other file formats, and perform many other manipulations."
"rsync","A utility for transferring data maintaining key file system properties such as modified date, and user permissions. The utility is found on Linux but can also be found in Win throug various mechanisms. A good combination of flags to use for rsync in digital preservation is -rlptDv. "

"Vera PDF","A free and open source tool for validation of PDF/A files. Provides some support for other PDF types."
"jpylyzer","A tool written in Python that characterizes JPEG2000 (JP2) files. Important in digitization workflows where JP2 is now taking a place for the savings in storage space over TIF. "
"droidsfmin","droidsfmin is a tool by Martin Hoppenheit to reduce the number of signatures in the DROID signature file, e.g. for the purpose of quicker identification in image format only workflows. "
"Rosetta","A large, OAIS compliant, system that enables large portions of the digital preservation workflow from ingest to delivery. Rosetta is maintained by Ex Libris. "
"Archivematica","An open source digital preservation system maintained by Artefactual. Younger than Preservica and Rosetta, Archivematica has a growing user-base, and a different support model to the two mentioned. "
"Preservica","Originally called Safety Deposit Box, Preservica is an OAIS compliant digital preservation system maintained by Preservica in Abingdon, Oxford, UK. "
"Safety Deposit Box","The first four implementations of the Preservica digital preservation system went under the label Safety Deposit Box, organisations such as The National Archives, UK, and Swiss Federal Archive, were some of the first to adopt this system. "

"Just Solve the File Format Problem","A wiki style registry of file formats that can be edited by all users. It differs from PRONOM in the regard that anyone can add information, and so it is a good idea to submit something to this wiki first, or in concert with PRONOM, for the benefit of the community. Just Solve It, is an initiative of the Internet Archive."
"Write Blocker","A hardware forensics device that blocks the ability to write to a storage device, thus protecting data and its evidentiary value. Write blocking tools are available from companies such as Tableau. "
"KryoFlux","A USB controller and write blocker for legacy floppy disk drives, speficially 3.5-inch and 5.25-inch disk drives. 8-inch disk drive support is feasible but the community has yet to find a consistent solution for that. Alternatives to Kryoflux are available."
"Supercard Pro","A USB controller and write blocker for legacy floppy disk drives, speficially 3.5-inch and 5.25-inch disk drives."
"Twitter","A useful way for those in digital preservation to connect with the community. An active forum with lots of branches out to other resources."

"Coptr","COPTR describes tools useful for long term digital presesrvation and acts primarily as a finding and evaluation tool to help practitioners find the tools they need to preserve digital data. COPTR is collating the knowledge of the digital preservation community on preservation tools in one place. Instead of organisations competing against each other with their own registries."
"TWARC","'Twitter’ archiving (twarc) is a command line tool and Python library for archiving Twitter JSON data. Each tweet is represented as a JSON object that is exactly what was returned from the Twitter API. Tweets are stored as line-oriented JSON. Twarc will handle Twitter API's rate limits for you. In addition to letting you collect tweets Twarc can also help you collect users, trends and hydrate tweet ids."
"WARC","ISO 28500:2009. A standardised format for storing the result of a web crawl – the output of web archiving efforts. WARC files many aggregate WARC records. WARC can encode any other file format – as you’d expect of any potential digital object on the web. "
"Wayback Machine","A search engine, and API for the archived web. Hosted by the Internet Archive, based in San Francisco. "
"Memento","A project led by the Los Alamos National Laboratory and Old Dominion University. Rather than expecting people to know about the growing number of Web archives, and to guess which archive might hold an older version of the resource they’re looking for, Memento proposes to make archived content discoverable via the original URL that the searcher already knew about. Essentially, Memento is an attempt to permit users to view any web page as it looked on a given date in the past. Memento does this by utilizing the time dimension built into the content negotiation capabilities of the HTTP protocol. "
"Shine","A search engine for the UK web archive at the British Library that enables both trend analysis, and content search and retrieval. "

"OAI-PMH","The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) is a low-barrier mechanism for repository interoperability. Data Providers are repositories that expose structured metadata via OAI-PMH. Service Providers then make OAI-PMH service requests to harvest that metadata. OAI-PMH is a set of six verbs or services that are invoked within HTTP."
"Hex Editor","Hex (Hexadecimal) editor, e.g. HxD, are tools for representing the binary content of a file in hexadecimal form, usually in contiguous rows of bytes. A hex editori is usually split into two panes, the left showing the hexadecimal form of the binary, and the right, showing the characters that can be rendered using the ASCII encoding scheme, or another scheme supported by the tool such as EBCIDIC. Hex editors are key tools in developing file format signatures."
